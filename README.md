## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

1. The system should simulate a real-life Board Room experience with relevant interview scenarios.
    
2. It should start with ice-breaking questions and progress to in-depth technical and managerial queries based on the candidate's level.
  
3. A scoring mechanism should be implemented to evaluate the relevance of questions in relation to the candidate’s expertise and the advertised position.
   
4. The system should assess the relevance of candidate responses to the questions asked, ensuring alignment with the job requirements.
 
5. Interviewers and candidates should receive quantifiable scores for question and answer relevance to ensure fairness and objectivity.
    
6. The overall scoring system should provide a comprehensive evaluation of the candidate's subject knowledge.
    
7. The final score should help determine the candidate’s suitability for the advertised post based on their performance in the interview.
